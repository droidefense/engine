        git commit -a -m 'X.X docs' 

4) Run the release.sh script

	cd $HOME/svn/local/simplemagic

		git tag -d simplemagic-0.6
		git push origin :simplemagic-0.6

5) Login to Sontype:    https://oss.sonatype.org/

6) Close and release the release:

	- Click on 'Staging Repositories' from left nav

	- Check off the release.
	- Click on 'close'.  Description: X.X release
